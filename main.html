As all the aspects of our lives are being transferred onto apps and 
websites, it's important for the general public to be literate about how
 "data tracking" works, and how computers can model human sentiment 
through their presence online alone. This blog hopes to explain how 
people's interactions with web technologies can be used to teach very 
societal and emotional things to computers, and illumate the potential 
gain and risks from that.

To give some fun context for what I mean, below is a form to test out a 
model's understanding of emojis, and the context of when to use them. 
This dataset used to train this neural network consisted of 1.3 billion 
tweets containing emojis. It can achieve some accurate results, given 
the sentence is emotionally charged enough. Below are some sample 
sentences to try (suggested by the Deepmoji Team).

<ul>
  <li>I love mom's cooking.</li>
  <li>My flight is delayed.. amazing</li>
  <li>I love how you never reply back...</li>
  <li>I love cruising with my homies</li>
  <li>I love messing with yo mind!!'</li>
  <li>This is the shit!</li>
  <li>This is shit.</li>
</ul>
